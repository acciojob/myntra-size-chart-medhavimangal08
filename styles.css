The reason the hover effect is not working in your case is due to the specificity of CSS selectors. The id selector (#first, #second, etc.) has higher specificity than the pseudo-class selector (:hover). Therefore, the background color assigned by the id selector is taking precedence over the color assigned by the hover effect.

To fix this, you can increase the specificity of the hover effect by including the id selectors. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

#first:hover, #second:hover, #third:hover, #fourth:hover {
    background-color: orange;
}
